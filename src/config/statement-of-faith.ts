    {
      heading: 'The Holy Scriptures',
      body: `We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the verbally inspired Word of God, the final authority for faith and life, inerrant in every matter in the original writing, infallible and God-breathed (2 Timothy 3:16-17).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Godhead',
      body: `We believe in one Triune God, eternally existing in three persons- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-co eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections (Deuteronomy 6:4; 2 Corinthians 13:14).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Person and Work of Christ',
      body: `We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, eternally God, became a man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men (Luke 1:35; John 1:1-2, 14).

We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitution sacrifice; and that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Romans 3:24-25; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:3-5; 2:24).

We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts 1: 9-11; Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25; 9:24; 1 John 2:1-2).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Creation and Man',
      body: `We believe that the book of Genesis presents a historically accurate account of the origin of man, the fall of Adam and Eve, and consequently the entire human race, the worldwide flood, the call of Abraham, and the origin of God’s chosen people, Israel. Included in this is our belief that special creation of the existing universe, consisting of time, space, and matter, was accomplished in six literals, twenty-four hour days, as detailed in Genesis chapter one.

We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that when man sinned the human race fell and became alienated from God. Man, thus, is totally depraved and of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition. (Genesis 1:26-27; 5:2; Psalm 51; Romans 3:22-23; 5:12; Ephesians 2:1-3, 12).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Salvation',
      body: `We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal and purposeful faith in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of sins (1 Corinthians 15:1-5; Ephesians 1:7; 2:8-10; 1 Peter 1:18-19).

We believe that while the death and resurrection of Christ is sufficient provision for the salvation of all men, only those who exercise saving faith will have forgiveness of sin and receive eternal life. Those who so exercise faith are then regenerated, baptized by the Holy Spirit into Christ, and granted every spiritual blessing in Christ (Romans 6:3-4; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 1:3-4; 2:8-9; Philippians 2:13; Titus 3:5; 1 John 2:2).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Eternal Security and Assurance of Believers',
      body: `We believe that all the justified, once saved, are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever (John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Romans 8:1, 38; 1 Corinthians 1:4-8; I Peter 1:5).

We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word; which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh (Romans 13:13-14; Galatians 5:13; Titus 2: 11-15: 1 John 5:10-13).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Two Natures of the Believer',
      body: `We believe that the regenerated person retains his corrupt, sinful, depraved nature, but at the moment of salvation also becomes a partaker of the divine nature, capable of pleasing God through the ministries of the indwelling Holy Spirit (Romans 6:13; 8:12-13; Galatians 5:16-25; Ephesians 4:22-24; Colossians 3:9-10; I Peter I: 14-16; I John 3:5-9).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Separation',
      body: `We believe that all the saved should live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Savior and Lord; and, that separation from all religious apostasy, all worldly and sinful pleasures, practices and associations is commanded by God (Romans 12:1-2, 14:13; 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; 2 Timothy3:1-5; 1 John 2:15-17; 2 John 9-11).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'Ministry and Spiritual Gifts',
      body: `We believe that God is sovereign in the bestowing of all His gifts; that the gifts of evangelist and pastor- teacher are given to the church for the equipping of the saints today; that each believer has a spiritual gift for the purpose of ministry to others, such as the gifts of ministry, helps, leadership, administration, exhortation, giving, mercy, and teaching; that the gifts of prophecy, speaking in tongues, and the working of sign miracles ceased as the New Testament Scriptures were completed and their authority became established (Romans 12:6-8 ; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 4:7-12; 1 Peter 4:10).

We believe that God does hear and answer the prayer of faith, in accord with His own will, for the sick and afflicted (John 15:7; James 5:14-15; 1 John 5:14-15).

We believe in the autonomy of the local church (Acts 13:1-4; 20:28; Romans 16:1; 1 Corinthians 3:9, 16; 5:4-7; 1 Peter 5:1-4).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Personality of Satan',
      body: `We believe that Satan is a person, the author of sin and cause of the fall; that he is the open and declared enemy of God and man; and, that he shall be eternally punished in the lake of fire (Job 1:6-7; Isaiah 14:12-17; Matthew 4:2-11; Revelation 20:11).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Second Advent of Christ',
      body: `We believe in that “blessed hope,” the personal, imminent, pre-tribulation and pre-millennial coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for the church; and in His subsequent return to earth, with His saints, to establish His Millennial Kingdom, which will begin only after the second advent (Zechariah 14:4-11; 1 Thessalonians 1:10; 4:13-18; 5:9; Revelation 3:10; 19:11-16; 20:1-6).`,
    },
    {
      heading: 'The Eternal State',
      body: `We believe in the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment (Matthew 25:46; John 5:28-29; 11:25-26; Revelation 20:5-6; 22:12).

We believe that the souls of the justified are, at death, absent from the body and present with the Lord, where in conscious bliss they await the first resurrection, when soul and body are reunited to be glorified forever with the Lord (Luke 23:43; 2 Corinthians 5:8; Philippians 1:23; 3:32;1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20:4-6). We believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious misery until the second resurrection, when with soul and body reunited they shall appear at the Great White Throne Judgment, and shall be cast into the lake of fire, not to be annihilated, but to suffer everlasting conscious punishment (Matthew 25:41-46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:19-26; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Jude 6-7; Revelation 20:11-15).`,
    },
    {
      heading:
        'How should we then live in view of the biblical message about the future?',
      body: `We should live according to Scripture, live as though we would appear before our Lord God in a matter of minutes or hours. As we so live, we should view every opportunity as though it might be the last one we will ever have. The Bible does not teach God’ s people to fold their hands and wait idly for Christ’s return. Rather, it emphasizes the need to be actively serving while we wait for God.`,
